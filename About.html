	<h1>All About Me!</h1>
	<p style="font-size: calc(5px + 1.5vw);">Hello beautiful people! My name is Bayleigh Clock and I am a Sophomore in the Graphic Design Program at Lesley University. I have always been drawn to the Design world ever since I can remember. When I was a little kid, I remember making all sorts of art projects with my mom. I have been freelancing my artwork for the past 4 years, doing orders for people that requested them. My favorite piece that I have ever created is probably the memorial pieces that I create for people. In my free time I like to crochet things for my family members and play Dungeons and Dragons with my friends from home. I also enjoy taking the train around the East Coast and going on all sorts of fun adventures with my friends.</p>
